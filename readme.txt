So any code I've ever written in my life that doesn't totally suck will be in this repository (including code that I have partial ownership of or code built on top of another which makes it a derivative work).  Some code was lost or destroyed before making this repository so of course it only includes the code that I still have access to.  This repository might not contain code that is in one of my other GIT repositories.  For example but not limited to, this repository contains code written during college, code written between jobs, and code written off the clock while employed.  For example but not limited to, this repository might not contain code written on the job - code I was paid to write while under NDA ... some such code might be in this repository, might but probably not.

I may backup other people's code in this repository, in which case I will put it all under a single root folder calling out that I did not contribute to the code as it stands in the version of the code put in that folder.

There will likely be multiple copies of the same code, even on the same branch.  The original folder includes the unedited version of code, in whatever state I found it in while digging through backups and archives.  There may be multiple versions of the same code in the original folder, for however many versions of the same code I find in the backups and archives.

I will have a separate folder for modifications to the original code.  The modified folder will most likely have one version of the same code per branch, based on whatever version in the original folder is the latest or a merge of all separate versions if there was more than one, subsequently built upon bug-fixed and modified.
