<li><b>MPFUN2020</b>: A thread-safe arbitrary precision package with special functions.

<p>
This package permits one to perform floating-point computations (real and complex) to arbitrarily high numeric precision, by making only relatively minor changes to existing Fortran-90 programs (mostly changes to type statements). All basic arithmetic operations and transcendental functions are supported, together with an extensive set of special functions and polynomial evaluation routines.

<p>
The package comes in two versions: one completely self-contained, all-Fortran version that is simple to install; and one version based on the MPFR package that is more complicated to install but runs somewhat faster on most applications. Both versions are completely thread-safe. Both versions also detect, and provide means to overcome, accuracy problems rooted in the usage of inexact double-precision constants and expressions. A high-level Fortran-90 interface, supporting both multiprecision real and complex datatypes, is provided for each, so that most users need only to make minor changes to existing double-precision code. The two versions are "plug-compatible" in the sense that applications written for one also run with the other (provided a simple guideline is followed). 

<p>
A technical paper describing the package and providing details for
usage is available here: <a href="https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbpapers/mpfun2020.pdf">MPFUN2020 technical paper (updated 30 May 2024)</a>.

<p>
The two versions of the software are available here:
<ul>
<li><b>MPFUN20-Fort</b> for Unix-based systems (including Apple OS X systems):
<a href="https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/mpfun10-fort-v32.tar.gz">
mpfun20-fort-v32.tar.gz</a>

<p>
MPFUN20-Fort: This is an all-Fortran version based on 8-byte integer arithmetic. It includes support for a medium precision datatype, which results in faster execution on very large problems, and features FFT-based multiplication to accelerate very high precision computations. It compiles in just a few seconds on any system with a Fortran-2008 compliant compiler (examples include the GNU gfortran compiler, the Intel ifort compiler and the NAG Fortran compiler).

<p>
For installation instructions, see this <a href="https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/README-mpfun20-fort.txt">README file</a> or <a href="https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/DHB-License.txt">
DHB-License.txt</a>. The README file also includes a brief summary of programming instructions, although the technical paper above has full details.</li>

<p>
<li><b>MPFUN20-MPFR</b> for Unix-based systems (including Apple OS X systems):
<a href="https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/mpfun20-mpfr-v32.tar.gz">
mpfun20-mpfr-v32.tar.gz</a>

<p>
MPFUN20-MPFR: This is virtually identical to MPFUN20-Fort in its user interface, but it calls the MPFR package for all low-level functions and operations. The MPFUN20-MPFR version is faster than MPFUN20-Fort on most applications, particularly those that involve transcendental functions. However, installation of MPFUN20-MPFR is significantly more complicated (because the GMP and MPFR packages must first be installed, usually requiring administrator privilege).

<p>
For installation instructions, see this <a href="https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/README-mpfun-mpfr.txt">README file</a>. The README file also includes a brief summary of programming instructions, although the technical paper above has full details.</li></ul>

<p>
<li><b>DQFUN</b>: A double-quad precision package with special functions (approximately 66 digit precision).

<p>
This package permits one to perform floating-point computations (real and complex) to double-quad precision (approximately 65 digits), by making only relatively minor changes to existing Fortran programs. All basic arithmetic operations and transcendental functions are supported, together with numerous special functions. The package should run correctly on any Unix-based system supporting a Fortran-2008 compiler and IEEE 128-bit floating-point arithmetic (in hardware or software).

<p>
<li><b>QXFUN</b>: A quad precision package with special functions (approximately 33 digit precision).

<p>
This package enhances an IEEE quad precision floating-point facility (approx. 33 digit accuracy) to include a library of numerous special functions, all by making only very minor changes to existing Fortran programs. The package should run correctly on any Unix-based system supporting a Fortran-2008 compiler and IEEE 128-bit floating-point arithmetic, in hardware or software.

<p>
<li><b>DDFUN</b>: A double-double package with special functions (approximately 30 digit precision).

<p>
This package permits one to perform floating-point computations (real and complex) to double-double precision (approximately 30 digits), by making only relatively minor changes to existing Fortran programs. It is intended as a substitute for IEEE 128-bit quad precision on systems where quad precision is not available. All basic arithmetic operations and transcendental functions are supported, together with numerous special functions. The package should run correctly on any Unix-based system supporting a Fortran-2008 compiler and IEEE 64-bit floating-point arithmetic.

<p>
This is an older all-Fortran version of the MPFUN software, based on floating-point arithmetic. It is several times slower than MPFUN2020. This version is still supported, but MPFUN2020 should be used for new development.
