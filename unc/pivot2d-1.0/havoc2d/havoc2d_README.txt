HAVOC2D README

\havoc2d: 2D Voronoi library.

Create library out of files in the directory. Example files will need to be linked to this library and the \havoc2d directory will need to be added to the include path.

\havoc2d_tutorial: simple havoc2d example program.

Compile main1.cpp using the opengl and glut libraries (www.opengl.org). The havoc2d library must also be linked.

\havoc2d_examples: more simple havoc2d example programs

Compile a single main*.cpp just like the havoc2d_tutorial program.

\havoc2d_nbody_example: more complex application using the havoc2d library

Compile all .cpp files along with one main*.cpp file. Link the same libraries as in the simpler examples.
