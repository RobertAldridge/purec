-- SWIFT Example Application --
-------------------------------

The sample application demonstrates the ease with which an application can use
the SWIFT system.  The provided example application first creates a SWIFT_Scene
object, then adds two randomly tesselated spheres to it.  The objects then
orbit one another for a given number of steps at a given velocity.  Also
demonstrated is the setting of transformations and querying.

1) First build the SWIFT library as desired (see README or user manual).

2) Type ``make example''.

3) To run the example program type ``example -h'' for a list of options.
