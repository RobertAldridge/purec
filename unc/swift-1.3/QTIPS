-- Tips on using QSlim and Qhull with SWIFT --
----------------------------------------------

These tips are not necessary if you are not using QSlim and Qhull
(SWIFT_HIERARCHY or SWIFT_QSLIM_HIER are undefined in SWIFT_config.h).


1) SWIFT has only been tested with Qhull v 2.6 and QSlim v 2.0.  Use other
   versions at your own risk.  The web sites are:
   Qhull: www.geom.umn.edu/software/qhull/ 
   QSlim: graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/software/qslim.html

2) Don't forget to point the -I flags in Makefile to the distributions of
   QSlim and Qhull on your system.

3) When you link, don't forget to put -lqhull, -lmix (or whatever you have
   named the libraries) after -lSWIFT.

4) If you are having trouble compiling QSlim it may help to comment out
   GL_SRCS and GUI_SRCS in qslim-2.0/mixkit/src/Makefile.

5) On the QSlim web site there is mention that it does not compile on VC++ 6
   unless you get the fix posted there.
