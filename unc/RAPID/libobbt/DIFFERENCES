This small package differs from I_Collide in several ways:

-- OBBTree does not contain any io routines.  You will have to write
   your own functions to read and parse files to obtain the polygons
   which define a model.  The ONLY way to feed a model to the OBBTree
   system is with the box::add_tri() member function, which takes
   the vertex coordinates of a triangle, and an id.

-- OBBTree operates only with triangles.  If your models contain
   polygons with more than 3 vertices, you will have to triangulate
   them yourself, and feed the triangles to OBBTree.

-- OBBTree has just one collision query function: collide().

-- OBBTree does not keep track of where the objects are.  You must
   specify where the objects are in world space on every collision
   query.

-- OBBTree does not report distances between models, only triangle
   contact pairs.  Pairs of triangle id's are returned by the
   collision query function.

-- OBBTree makes no use of frame-to-frame coherence in the motion of
   objects.

-- OBBTree contains support for pair-wise collision queries only.
   There is as yet no support for multiple object collision detection.
   Support may added at a later date.
