This software works with g++ and gcc.

To make the collision detection library, type

	make library

The test programs t.C and t_plain_c.c illustrate how to make use of
the library with C++ or C, respectively.  The test programs construct
a pair of tori, and perform collision queries between them.

Before making the test programs, you must first compile the simple
vector/matrix library (in libSVM).  To do so, type (with csh),

	(cd ../libSVM; make library)

To make the test programs, type,

	make t; 

or

	make t_plain_c
