This repository contains OpenXR headers, as well as source code and build scripts
for the OpenXR loader.
It contains all generated source files and headers pre-generated for minimum dependencies.

The authoritative public repository for this project is located at
<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK>.

The public repository containing the scripts that generate the files in this repository
is located at
<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK-Source>.
It hosts the public Issue tracker, and accepts patches (Pull Requests) from the
general public.
That repository is also where sample code (hello_xr) and API layer source can be found.

**Note that this repo is effectively read-only: changes to this repo should be made in the [OpenXR-SDK-Source](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK-Source) repo instead**

## Building

The project is set up to build using CMake.

### (Optional) Building the OpenXR Loader as a DLL

By default, the OpenXR loader is built as a static library on Windows and a dynamic library on other platforms.
To specify alternate behavior, define the CMake option `DYNAMIC_LOADER`,
e.g. by adding `-DDYNAMIC_LOADER=ON` or `-DDYNAMIC_LOADER=OFF` to your CMake command line.

### Linux

The following set of Debian/Ubuntu packages provides all required libs for building for xlib or xcb with OpenGL and Vulkan support.

- `build-essential`
- `cmake` (of _somewhat_ recent vintage, 3.10+ known working)
- `libgl1-mesa-dev`
- `libvulkan-dev`
- `libx11-xcb-dev`
- `libxcb-dri2-0-dev`
- `libxcb-glx0-dev`
- `libxcb-icccm4-dev`
- `libxcb-keysyms1-dev`
- `libxcb-randr0-dev`
- `libxrandr-dev`
- `libxxf86vm-dev`
- `mesa-common-dev`

Specific sample command lines for building follow.
If you're already familiar with the process of building a project with
CMake, you may skim or skip these instructions.

#### Linux Debug

```sh
mkdir -p build/linux_debug
cd build/linux_debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
make
```

#### Linux Release

```sh
mkdir -p build/linux_release
cd build/linux_release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
make
```
